Deployment Document:


WARNING: Due to manipulation of large data sets, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED this program is run on a machine with at least 8GB of ram.


This instructions in this document assume that the eclipse project has been successfully opened and contains the following files and folders:
	-src folder: 
	
		-default package: BinarySearch.java, BreadthFirstPaths.java, Controller, java, DangerRating.java, Digraph.java, FrontendText.java,
				 GraphContruction.java, MergeSort.java, Queue.java, ReadCSV.java, SaferCities.java, Stack.java, vProb.java, writeJSON.java
				 
		-DangerRatingOutput.txt (will be overwritten if it available, new one made when the code is run if not available)
		-HeatMap.html
		-Makefile (if running on command line, to remove .class files)
		-map.geojson
		-output.json
				 
	
	-Data_Sets folder: 
		
		-Canada_Cities.csv, CDD_csv.csv, eqarchive-en.csv, uscities.csv, stormdata_2003.csv-stormdata_2013.csv
	

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

	1) To run the program, run the class named Controller.java. This may take a few seconds, as data is being loaded and manipulated.
	
	2) Once loading is complete, there will be a message asking for the inputs. The format of the inputs is specified in the message, it 
		is the city name and month number for which danger rating needs to be found separated by a space. Failure to follow this format
		will lead to wrong outputs. Ensure that the city entered is either in the US or Canada.
		
	3) After entering a valid city and month, the program will display the danger rating out 100 with the word stating the danger level
		in brackets. It will also display neighbouring cities that are safe.
		
	4) A heatmap is also created for the specified month over the US and Canada on a World Map. To open the heatmap, double click the file
		"HeatMap.html." The file will be opened in eclipse or the browser (depending on where it is being run). You may need to zoom out using
		"-" button located bottom right. The heatmap displayed shows the dangerous areas in the US and Canda for the specified month.
		

WHAT DO THE COLOURS MEAN ON THE HEATMAP?
	
	-No colour overlay: SAFE zone
	-Green overlay: 	LOW danger zone
	-Yellow overlay:	MODERATE danger zone
	-Red overlay:		HIGH danger zone
